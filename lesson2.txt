git init
git checkout branch_id
git log --graph --oneline branch_1 branch_2
git status

git add then git commit
git diff --staged   (after git add)

git show commit_id (compare commit_id and its parrent)

git merge branch1 branch2 or switch the one branch and merge another with only one branch name

solving conflict by merging two branches with their co-ancestors
note for <<<HEAD and etc...


git branch branch_id to create a branch
